# API Gateway Challenge

Here you'll find some information on my experience with the [Contino API
Challenge](https://github.com/contino/tc-apigateway).

## Thank You

Hello and thank you for letting me take the challenge!

Thank you for spending your time marking my solution and reading this :)

## [How To Play](https://www.youtube.com/embed/PVHx47Xyhow?start=0&end=2)

This solution is directed by a [Makefile](Makefile) which allows you to
overwrite the following variables:
- **profile:** AWS CLI Options
- **region:** AWS Region
- **profile:** AWS Config Profile Name
- **cli_opts:** All AWS CLI Options
- **subcommand_opts:** AWS CLI Subcommand Parameters
- **template:** path/to/template.file (or 3)
- **stack_name:** Name your stacks to claim your stacks!
- **capabilities:** "CAPABILITY_IAM"

### Dependencies

Please make sure that you've installed the
[AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/index.html).

You'll also need to have configured the AWS CLI, to specify a profile that
the AWS CLI will use to deploy the CloudFormation stack.

### What To Expect

First, some simple steps to get you going:

1. Clone the repository
1. Open your terminal in the repository
1. Know which AWS profile you want to run this with
1. Run `make profile=<your-aws-profile> deploy`
1. Observe that the stack is creating...

#### Building the Infrastructure

You should see an output similar to the following:

```output
üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª in tc-apigateway
make profile=<profile-name> deploy
./scripts/deploy -c '--profile <profile-name> --region us-east-2' -s '--stack-name tc-apigateway-stack-20190918203619 --template-file ./cloudformation/tc_apigateway.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_IA
M'
Deploying stack with: aws --profile <profile-name> --region us-east-2 cloudformation deploy --stack-name tc-apigateway-stack-20190918203619 --template-file ./cloudformation/tc_apigateway.yaml --capa
bilities CAPABILITY_IAM

Waiting for changeset to be created..
Waiting for stack create/update to complete
Successfully created/updated stack - tc-apigateway-stack-20190918203619
```

Once the command has returned, hopefully you can check the stack resources:

```shell
aws --profile <profile-name> --region us-east-2 \
cloudformation list-stack-resources \
--stack-name tc-apigateway-stack-20190918203619 \
--output table \
--query "StackResourceSummaries[*].{\
 "ResourceStatus": ResourceStatus,\
 "ResourceType": ResourceType,\
 "LogicalResourceId": LogicalResourceId,\
 "PhysicalResourceId":PhysicalResourceId\
}"
```

Which should show:

```output

#### Making Requests

Now you can POST to the API

```shell
curl -L "https://907yi7vcia.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/v1/add_new" \
	-X POST \
	-d '{
    "team_country": "Aussie",
    "team_name": "TeamMikey",
    "team_desc": "good at this sport",
    "team_rating": "10/10"
  }' \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-H "x-api-key: $(aws --profile <profile-name> --region us-east-2 apigateway get-api-keys --include-values --query items[*].value --output text)";
```

Note that your API hey is never assigned to the environment or printed
anywhere (or contained in this repository).

## Tasks

Let's take a look at the tasks and what I managed to achieve

- [x] Team data added/updated in DynamoDB Table via API Gateway POST request
- [x] Add an API Key to restrict client-side access to the the API Gateway
- [ ] Notifications for DB Updates

## Deliverables

-   [x] Share your code with us through your own git repository

-   [x] Make sure that all resources required by your stack are included on the
        deployment process.

-   [x] Include a README with details on how to run your code

-   [x] Consider security on all pieces of your work.
    - Thought about this a lot, I wonder if it shows; however, I'm doubtful
      that it does.  

-   [x] README a section with recommended improvement...

### Roadmap

Some things I'd love to do if I could spend some more time:

-   [ ] Create tests for Lambda code

-   [ ] Separating the Lambda from the CloudFormation template

-   [ ] Splitting the template into 3 components to a CDK app

-   [ ] Creating a CircleCI pipeline

-   [ ] Update API Keys automatically on a regular basis

-   [ ] Using SSM Parameter Store to manage secrets

-   [ ] Using UpdateItem() instead of PutItem()

-   [ ] There are probably many DB optimisations that could be made

-   [ ] Using API to directly update the Table, rather than
        creating a Lambda

-   [ ] Review API's permission to execute the Lambda function from any
        /${Stage}/${Method}/${ApiSpecificResourcePath}. See below:

-   [ ] Locking the SourceARN down in the [APIPermission](https://github.com/mikey-/tc-apigateway-solution/master/blob/cloudformation/tc_apigateway.yaml#L80)
        AWS::Lambda::Permission resource, to include the
        "/${Stage}/${Method}/${ApiSpecificResourcePath}".
        See [Resources Defined by Amazon API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_amazonapigateway.html#amazonapigateway-resources-for-iam-policies)
        for more information.

### Other Thoughts

HERE'S WHAT ELSE I THINK:

It'd would be worth looking into the benefits of improving the stylistic 
elements of the challenge's documentation, code and templates.

I probably complained about doing this test a lot, but I really did enjoy the
process and found it to be very rewarding. Arguably the most valuable lessons
I learned through this were:

-   **Assumptions:**
    I unconsciously assumed that _pretty much knew what I had to know about API
    Gateway_; when in fact, I  don't have much of an understanding how modern
    APIs work in general, let alone the particularities of a product made of
    complex systems which can generate modern web APIs.

-   **Makefiles are alright:**
    I kind of thought they were annoying for a bunch of IaC projects.
    I guess I still do but I see their utility a lot more :)  

There's probably a lot more on that I've forgotten about.

It'd be great to have done this with someone, pair programming styles.

#### Oh, one last thing

Did I get the job?!
